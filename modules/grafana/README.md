# Aptible Grafana Resources

This module is responsible for managing the Grafana resources necessary to
visualize and monitor metrics collected by Aptible Metric Drains. Use this
module to apply the Grafana dashboards and alert rules to an existing Grafana
instance. The module creates its own folder for the resources it manages so as
to not interfere with other resources.
